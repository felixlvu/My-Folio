# My-Folio
The aim of this project is to showcase my personal and professional work. 
On this showcase site, you can explore some of my projects without having to download them. 
What's more, an emulator is incorporated into the site,
enabling you to test a specific project directly online.
For other projects that are not directly testable, you'll find detailed descriptions and illustrative images.
